        <h2>Crucial UX Design Knowledge</h2>
        <h3>What is UX design?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It’s important to start by saying there’s no commonly accepted definition for UX design.</li>
            <li>User experience design is a concept that has many dimensions, and it includes a bunch of different <br>disciplines—such as interaction design, information architecture, visual design, usability, and human-computer interaction.</li>
            <li>But let’s try to get a clearer picture of what that really means.</li>
          </ul>
            <figure>

            </figure>
          
        <h3>1. Get Started: Things to Do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Master a tool (Figma) or (Adobe XD) or (Sketch)</li>
          <li>Practice tools on your free time</li>
          <li>Take a UX, UI, or Web Design course</li>
          <li>Do research and redisign some of your favorite websites for more experience</li>
          <li>Think about solutions, improvements, and design with the intent to create and solve problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. What you should expect to do while learning/doing UX design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Research</li>
          <li>Case Studeis</li>
          <li>Wireframing</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>
          <li>Mockups</li>
          <li>Being able to create pretty and aesthetic designs isn’t good enough. You have to show that you’re <br> able to design with the intent to improve and solve problems that users may face.</li>
        </ul>
          
          <h3>3. Softwares for UX Design</h3>

        <h4>Here is a very in depth guide on how to get started in UX design. <br> It also notes the things you should be thinking about and how <br> your
          mentality should be when entering this field.</h4>

          <h2 class="ooo">Crucial Web <br> Design Skills</h2>
          <h4>Design Principles</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You don’t need to know music theory to write a song, and if you’ve never taken an art class, you can still draw. <br> Some of us might have an innate artistic ability, but knowing the basic fundamentals can make the difference <br> between recreating what you see and being able to build a design that’s calculated and unique.
            </li>

            <li>
              These fundamentals are the foundation of web and graphic design and important to know. Whether you’re <br> designing a portfolio or a print ad, these concepts can help guide your work. Let’s do a quick recap.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>
            <img src="assets/img/web.jpg" alt="uximg" width="720" height="420"/>
          </figure>

          <h2>1. Typography</h2>
          <p>Typography shapes our perception of ideas. A type’s weight and geometry communicates meaning, <br> and as a designer, it’s important to know the best way to deliver messaging with the appropriate <br> typographical choices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All the font options can make it hard for new designers to know what to choose. Practical fonts like Georgia, <br> Verdana, and Roboto work well for body copy, while more decorative typefaces should be used sparingly as <br> ornamentation. Good designers know the difference between type styles and where to use them.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are plenty of resources on the web to help broaden your typographic knowledge. FONTS IN USE <br> shows different typefaces applied to a variety of media. Tools like Font combinations for web designers <br> can give you ideas for possible pairings.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <figure>

          </figure>
        </article>

        <h2>2. Software for Design</h2>
        <p>Adobe Illustrator, XD, Photoshop, Figma, and Webflow are a few design software programs designers <br> should be familiar with. You should have a grasp of photo-editing basics and the ability to tweak <br> vector-based graphics, like a logo that may come your way.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For those on a budget, free photo-editing software like Gimp or the vector-based Inkscape will <br> give you the power to do what you need to do without spending a ton of money. And, as you <br> develop your web design skills, animation software like Motion or After Effects are handy tools <br> to add motion and pizzazz to your work. 
          </li>

          <li>
            And then there’s the platform you’ll use to create your site. Webflow has an intuitive interface that <br> generates flawless code for you — we think it’s the perfect choice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/img/1_design_tools.jpg" alt="uximg" width="740" height="400"/>
        </figure>

        <h2>3. HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p>Gaining thorough knowledge about HTML (Hypertext markup language) and CSS <br> (Cascading style sheets) is one of the finest web designer skills that you can aim to learn. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML and CSS are the fundamental blocks upon which the style and structure of a website are built.</li>
          <li>They enable you to read and edit a page, as often as you want to.</li>
          <li>By learning these principal languages, you will easily be able to secure a decent web design job.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="conclude">One of the key slills to a successful product is the creation of effective, efficient and visually pleasing <br> displays. In order to produce such high-quality displays, whether they are graphical (e.g., websites) <br> or tangible (e.g., remote controls), an understanding of human vision is required, along with the <br> knowledge of visual perception. By observing, researching, and identifying examples of our <br> perceptual abilities, we can design products according to these unifying qualities.</p>
